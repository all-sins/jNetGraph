// Mara is tackling this. Supposedly done.
TODO: 1. Better authentication, that uses the password to send hashes.

TODO: 2. Use HTTPS. Generate certificate and use it.

3. Don't e.printStackTrace(), because it's basically a System.out.print(). Throw custom exceptions in general. Check SpeedtestCLIProcessException.class.

4. Correctly use Logger and it's levels INFO - DEBUG in whole project.

TODO: 5. Test coverage for TsuImplController.


TODO: FIXME: Bug -> set interval first then start measuring
